# Advanced Techniques

## Introduction

In this lesson, we'll explore advanced techniques commonly used in natural language processing tasks. These techniques play a crucial role in improving the performance and robustness of language models. We'll cover dropout regularization, beam search decoding, and handling unknown words.

## Lesson Content

### Dropout Regularization

- **Dropout**: A regularization technique used to prevent overfitting in neural networks.
- **Definition**: Dropout randomly drops a fraction of neurons (or connections) from the neural network during training.
- **Purpose**: By randomly dropping neurons, dropout prevents the network from relying too much on specific features or relationships, thus improving generalization.
- **Implementation**: Dropout is typically applied to hidden layers during training and scaled accordingly during inference.

### Beam Search Decoding

- **Beam Search**: A search algorithm used to generate sequences of words in natural language generation tasks.
- **Definition**: Beam search maintains a set of candidate sequences (beams) and systematically explores possible continuations of each beam.
- **Purpose**: Beam search generates diverse and fluent sequences by exploring multiple potential paths and selecting the most promising ones based on a scoring criterion (e.g., likelihood).
- **Implementation**: Beam search is commonly used in sequence generation tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and dialogue generation.

### Handling Unknown Words

- **Unknown Words**: Words that are not present in the vocabulary of the language model.
- **Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) Tokens**: Special tokens used to represent unknown words in the model's vocabulary.
- **Handling Strategies**:
  - **Replace with UNK Token**: Replace unknown words with a special UNK token during tokenization.
  - **Subword Tokenization**: Use subword tokenization techniques (e.g., Byte Pair Encoding, SentencePiece) to handle unknown words by breaking them down into smaller units.
  - **Character-Level Models**: Train the model at the character level to handle unknown words explicitly.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we've explored advanced techniques commonly used in natural language processing tasks, including dropout regularization, beam search decoding, and handling unknown words. These techniques are essential for improving the performance, robustness, and versatility of language models. In the next lesson, we'll delve into optimization techniques aimed at improving the training efficiency and convergence of language models.
