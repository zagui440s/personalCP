# Intro to LM's

## What are we trying to accomplish?

By learning about language models (LMs), their utilities, and familiarizing yourself with PyTorch tensors, you aim to understand and harness the power of natural language processing (NLP) techniques for various tasks such as text generation, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and more. Language models are essential tools in NLP, capable of capturing complex linguistic patterns and generating coherent text. PyTorch tensors serve as the fundamental data structure for building and manipulating neural networks, enabling efficient computation on GPUs and facilitating the implementation of sophisticated deep learning models for NLP tasks. By mastering these concepts and tools, you aspire to develop robust and scalable solutions for real-world NLP challenges, contributing to advancements in AI-driven language understanding and generation.
