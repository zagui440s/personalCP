# Building Your First Language Model

## Introduction

In this lecture, we'll take the first step in building your own language model (LM) using PyTorch. We'll start by implementing a basic LSTM-based language model and understanding its architecture and parameters.

## Lesson Content

### Implementing a Basic LSTM-based Language Model with PyTorch

- **PyTorch Implementation**:
  - PyTorch provides a convenient way to build and train neural networks, including language models.
  - We'll implement a basic LSTM-based language model using PyTorch's `torch.nn` module.
  - Let's start by defining the architecture of our language model:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class LSTM_LanguageModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim, hidden_dim, num_layers):
        super(LSTM_LanguageModel, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(embedding_dim, hidden_dim, num_layers, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, vocab_size)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        embedded = self.embedding(x)
        output, _ = self.lstm(embedded)
        output = self.fc(output)
        return output
```

### Understanding Model Architecture and Parameters

- **Model Architecture**:
  - Our basic LSTM-based language model consists of an embedding layer, an LSTM layer, and a fully connected layer.
  - The embedding layer converts input tokens into dense vectors.
  - The LSTM layer processes the embedded tokens and captures sequential dependencies.
  - The fully connected layer predicts the probability distribution over the vocabulary.

- **Model Parameters**:
  - **Embedding Dimension**: Size of the dense embedding vectors for each token.
  - **Hidden Dimension**: Size of the hidden state in the LSTM.
  - **Number of Layers**: Number of LSTM layers in the model.
  - **Vocabulary Size**: Number of unique tokens in the vocabulary.

## Conclusion

In this lecture, we've taken the first step in building your own language model by implementing a basic LSTM-based model using PyTorch. We've discussed the model architecture and parameters, which are crucial for understanding how the model works and how to configure it for different tasks. In the next lesson, we'll move on to training our language model and fine-tuning it for specific applications.
