# Model Deployment

## Introduction

In this lecture, we'll explore the process of deploying a trained language model for practical use. Deploying a model involves saving and loading trained parameters and serving the model through an application or API. We'll cover techniques for saving and loading trained models and using Flask to serve our model as a web service.

## Lesson Content

### Saving and Loading Trained Models

- **Saving Trained Models**: After training a language model, it's essential to save the trained parameters to disk for later use.
  - **Serialization**: Serialize the model parameters using libraries like PyTorch's `torch.save()` or TensorFlow's `model.save()`.
  - **File Formats**: Save the model in a commonly used format such as `.pt`, `.h5`, or `.pb`.
- **Loading Trained Models**: When deploying the model, load the saved parameters from disk to initialize the model.
  - **Deserialization**: Deserialize the saved model using corresponding loading functions (`torch.load()` or `tf.keras.models.load_model()`).
  - **Verification**: Ensure that the loaded model matches the architecture and parameters of the trained model.

### Serving Your Model Using Flask

- **Flask**: Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python, commonly used for building web applications and APIs.
- **Model Serving**: Use Flask to create a web service that exposes your language model for inference.
  - **API Endpoint**: Define an API endpoint where clients can send input data and receive model predictions.
  - **Request Handling**: Parse incoming requests, preprocess input data (if necessary), and forward it to the language model for inference.
  - **Response Generation**: Generate a response containing the model predictions and return it to the client.

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import torch

# Initialize Flask app
app = Flask(__name__)

# Load pre-trained language model
model = torch.load('trained_model.pt')

# Define API endpoint for model inference
@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    # Get input data from request
    input_data = request.json['text']
    
    # Perform inference with the model
    prediction = model(input_data)
    
    # Return prediction as JSON response
    return jsonify({'prediction': prediction})

# Run Flask app
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

## Conclusion

In this lecture, we've explored the process of deploying a trained language model for practical use. By saving and loading trained models, we can reuse the learned parameters for inference tasks. Additionally, using Flask, we can serve our model as a web service, allowing other applications to interact with it via API calls. In the next lesson, we'll dive into building a fully functional language model application using these deployment techniques.
