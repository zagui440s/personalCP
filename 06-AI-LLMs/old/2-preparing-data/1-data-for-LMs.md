# Understanding Data for Language Modeling

## Introduction

In this lecture, we'll explore the key concepts related to understanding data for language modeling (LM). Understanding the structure of text data, including the corpus, tokenization, and vocabulary, is essential for effectively processing and training language models.

## Lesson Content

### Corpus

- The **corpus** refers to a collection of text documents used for training and evaluation in natural language processing tasks.
- It can consist of various types of text data, such as books, articles, social media posts, or transcripts.
- Let's visualize a simple example of a corpus:

```plaintext
Corpus:
- Document 1: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
- Document 2: "A stitch in time saves nine."
- Document 3: "To be or not to be, that is the question."
```

### Tokenization

- **Tokenization** is the process of breaking text into smaller units, usually words or subwords, called tokens.
- It's a crucial preprocessing step before training a language model.
- Let's tokenize a sample sentence from our corpus:

```python
# Sample sentence
sentence = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

# Tokenization using whitespace as delimiter
tokens = sentence.split()
print("Tokens:", tokens)
```

### Vocabulary

- The **vocabulary** of a language model consists of all unique tokens present in the corpus.
- It represents the set of words or subwords that the language model has learned during training.
- Let's build the vocabulary for our example corpus:

```python
# Corpus
corpus = [
    "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",
    "A stitch in time saves nine.",
    "To be or not to be, that is the question."
]

# Tokenize all documents in the corpus
all_tokens = [token for doc in corpus for token in doc.split()]

# Build vocabulary (set of unique tokens)
vocabulary = set(all_tokens)
print("Vocabulary:", vocabulary)
```

## Conclusion

In this lecture, we've explored the fundamental concepts related to understanding data for language modeling. We've covered the corpus, tokenization, and vocabulary, which are essential components for processing text data and training language models effectively. In the next lesson, we'll delve deeper into data processing techniques and prepare our text data for training a language model.
