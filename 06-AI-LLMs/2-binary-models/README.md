# Building Binary Classification Models

## What are we trying to accomplish?

By learning to build PyTorch binary classification models and process data with Pandas and scikit-learn, you aim to develop a strong foundation in machine learning and data analysis. This skill set will enable you to effectively prepare, manipulate, and analyze datasets, train robust models for predictive tasks, and evaluate their performance. Ultimately, your goal is to leverage these tools to solve real-world problems, improve decision-making processes, and enhance your proficiency in developing data-driven applications.
