# Preparing for Training

## Introduction

Before we embark on training our language model, it's essential to properly prepare for the training process. In this lesson, we'll cover key aspects such as setting up training parameters and choosing an appropriate loss function.

## Lesson Content

### Setting Up Training Parameters

- **Batch Size**: The number of training examples processed in one iteration (or batch) during training. A larger batch size can lead to faster training but may require more memory.
- **Learning Rate**: The step size at which the model parameters are updated during training. It controls the size of the updates to the model weights and affects the convergence of the training process.
- **Number of Epochs**: The number of times the entire training dataset is passed forward and backward through the model during training. Increasing the number of epochs can improve the model's performance but may also lead to overfitting.

### Choosing a Loss Function

- **Loss Function**: The function that computes the discrepancy between the predicted output of the model and the actual target output. It quantifies how well the model is performing on the training data.
- **Common Loss Functions**:
  - **Cross-Entropy Loss**: Often used for classification tasks, including language modeling. It calculates the difference between the predicted probability distribution and the true distribution of the target.
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Typically used for regression tasks. It calculates the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values.
  - **Negative Log Likelihood (NLL)**: Suitable for probabilistic models, including language models. It measures the negative log probability of the true target given the predicted output.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we've covered the essential aspects of preparing for training a language model. Setting up training parameters such as batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs is crucial for controlling the training process and optimizing model performance. Additionally, choosing an appropriate loss function is essential for guiding the optimization process and measuring the model's performance during training. In the next lesson, we'll dive into the training process itself and learn how to train our language model using PyTorch.
