# Overview of Language Model Architecture

## Introduction

In this lecture, we'll provide an overview of the different architectures commonly used in language modeling. Understanding these architectures, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and Transformers, is essential for building effective language models.

## Lesson Content

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

- **RNNs** are a type of neural network architecture designed to process sequential data.
- They have a recurrent connection that allows information to persist over time steps.
- RNNs are suitable for modeling sequences but suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, limiting their ability to capture long-range dependencies.

### Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)

- **LSTMs** are a variant of RNNs designed to address the vanishing gradient problem.
- They incorporate memory cells and gating mechanisms that allow them to retain information over long sequences.
- LSTMs are better at capturing long-range dependencies and are widely used in various NLP tasks, including language modeling.

### Transformers

- **Transformers** are a novel architecture introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. (2017).
- They rely entirely on self-attention mechanisms to compute representations of input sequences.
- Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art results in many NLP tasks and have become the architecture of choice for many language modeling tasks, including large-scale pretraining and fine-tuning.

## Conclusion

In this lecture, we've provided an overview of the different architectures commonly used in language modeling, including RNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers. Each architecture has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of architecture depends on the specific requirements of the task at hand. In the next lesson, we'll dive deeper into building our first language model using one of these architectures.
