# Workflow Automations:  Unit Tests & Builds

## What are we trying to accomplish?

By learning about Github Actions, developers can better prepare for the growing integration of DevOps practices into organizational workflows.  

As a DevOps automation tool provided by GitHub, GHA allows developers to automate their software workflows directly from their GitHub repositories.  Integrated with GitHub's code review and collaboration features, GHA provides a seamless DevOps experience for developers.

Workflows can be triggered based on various events such as code pushes, pull requests, and issue updates. They can include multiple actions, each performing a specific task, such as building and testing code, deploying to various environments, sending notifications, and more.

GitHub Actions supports a wide range of programming languages, platforms, and deployment targets, making it a versatile tool for automating software development workflows.  It also provides a marketplace of pre-built actions that can be easily integrated into workflows.
