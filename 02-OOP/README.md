# Intro to Object Oriented Programming with Python

## What are we trying to accomplish?

By delving into prompt engineering and mastering Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python—Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Composition—I aim to cultivate a deep understanding of structuring and optimizing code for enhanced efficiency and maintainability. In the realm of prompt engineering, the goal is to harness the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) by constructing well-crafted prompts that facilitate effective communication with these models. Simultaneously, through OOP in Python, the objective is to architect robust, modular, and scalable software solutions by leveraging the core tenets of abstraction for managing complexity, encapsulation for data protection, inheritance for code reuse, polymorphism for flexibility, and composition for building intricate systems. This dual proficiency equips me to engineer sophisticated applications, capitalize on the capabilities of language models, and contribute to advancements in both artificial intelligence and software development.
