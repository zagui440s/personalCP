# React Router Hooks

## What are we Trying to Accomplish?

By learning about React Router DOM hooks such as useParams, useNavigate, and useOutletContext, you aim to enhance proficiency in building dynamic and navigable web applications with React. The useParams hook allows you to extract parameters from the URL, enabling the creation of versatile components that respond dynamically to different routes. The useNavigate hook empowers you to programmatically navigate between routes, providing greater control over the user experience and enabling seamless transitions within the application. Additionally, understanding useOutletContext allows both access and manipulation of the context of the current outlet, facilitating more sophisticated navigation logic. Together, these hooks contribute to your ability in creating responsive, interactive, and well-organized web applications using React Router DOM.
