# Intro to React Router

## What are we Trying to Accomplish?

By learning to add routing to your React + Vite project using react-router-dom, you aim to create a seamless and interactive user experience within a single web application. This involves defining different views or pages, allowing users to navigate between them, ensuring that each page has a unique URL for bookmarking and sharing, and handling error pages gracefully. Overall, this knowledge enables you to build multi-page-like applications, respond to user interactions, and enhance the overall usability and functionality of your web application.
