# Personal Project Kickoff

Congratulations for making it to the Personal Project kickoff! Here you will utilized the skills you've mastered in the program to build your very own full stack application utilizing (but not limited to) the technologies, tools, and practices we've covered.

## Requirements

- React front-end, Django back-end, and PostgreSQL

For this assessment you must:

- Implement the use of at least two 3rd party APIs
- Implement the use of at least two CRUD-ing resources
- Implement User Authentication
- Implement proper back-end Models and Database design
- Implement proper styling, presentation, and site navigation
- Implement a feature-rich application demonstrating proper web design principles

## Grading Standards

This project will be graded on a presentation basis. Meaning you will present your project as in a technical conference format while instructors grade your application.

[Here is an example script for **Personal Project Presentations**](../optional_lessons/script.md)

## Getting Started

Please take a look at the example below and ensure to submit a your project idea to instructional staff for approval!

| Student         | Project Title           | Project Presentation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Joe Smucketally   | DinoStocks | - CRUD: Users will be able to create portfolios with shares of dinosaurs, update (buy/sell) shares, delete (sell all) shares of dinosaurs as they help invest in a new dinosaur theme park. Users can also create, update, delete, and view watchlists for dinosaurs they are interested in. - Authentication: Users will be able to register, log in, and log out to this application. - APIs: This application will use stock market APIs (such as Real Stonks: https://rapidapi.com/amansharma2910/api/realstonks) to connect each dinosaur with a real-life stock to emulate the ups and downs of the stock market. Popular stocks will relate to popular dinosaurs (i.e. Apple - Trex), while speculative stocks will relate to new dinosaur breeds (i.e. Indoraptor). - Pitch: Learning about the stock market and investment can be difficult, but not anymore. Welcome to DinoStocks, where you can experience the thrill of investing in dinosaurs in a simulated stock market environment. DinoStocks provides a fund and educational platform to learn about investments, all while enjoying the excitement of managing your very own dinosaur portfolio. |

Once your project has been approved you are good to start the planning and development process.

Good luck and happy coding!
