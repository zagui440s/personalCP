# How to Make a Good README

## Introduction

The README file contains critical information for other developers on how to install, configure, and run your project. This is important for your teammates, other devs who may be using your 
project if it is open-source, and for yourself six months from now.

A project without a good README is looked up poorly by professional. 

As early-career software engineers, since the first thing anyone will see if they look at your project repo on github is your README, the README is also effectively a part of your portfolio and should be treated as such.

## Lesson

### What goes in a README?

A good README must include:

- What is this & why?
- Installation
- Setup & Configuration
- Usage

As early-career engineers, yours should also include:

- An embedded video or gif of the app in action at the top of the README. If this is not possible some sort of relevant image should be included.
- If the the project is deployed live, a link to the live site.

### Make it your own

Have fun with your README! As long as your README clearly communicates to others what they need to know to use your code, you can and should make your README's fun. If you prefer to keep it to-the-point, that's fine as well.

As long as your README communicates the essential information

A good README is important and the mark of a professional software engineer. It also makes it easier for others (including yourself down the line) to use your work. Finally, it's a good opportunity to build your dev portfolio.
