# White-boarding Problems & Technical Interviews, Data Structures Review

## What are we trying to accomplish?

You will learn and begin to practice the strategy to use to successfully solve whiteboarding / technical interview problems. It is also helpful as a general program design technique.

You will become more familiar with leetcode since there is a strong chance that in the interview process you will do a coding challenge or problem in leetcode or a similar tool.

## Instructor Notes & Prerequisites

If possible review data structures but the priority is introducing how to tackle whiteboarding problems. **Two instructors should demo doing a technical interview problem on leetcode.**

## Lectures & Assignments

- [Lecture: Brief overview of the leetcode platform](./1-leetcode.md)
  - Assignment - Students do the Cassie's Data Structures Workshop Problems from [this list of leetcode problems](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nrFWrZSIDsGW3vUalt4zIqorE2xuRB5Au3zkMzNY-uQ/edit?usp=sharing).
    - Try to finish all the "dictionaries", "arrays", and "strings" problems.
- [Lecture: How to succeed at whiteboarding problems](./2-how-to-succeed-at-whiteboarding-problems.md)
  - [**Here is a shorter "cheat sheet" for Whiteboarding Problems**](./resources/whiteboarding-problems-cheat-sheet.md)
  - [Sort a linked list](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-list/)
  - [Remove nodes from LL](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nodes-from-linked-list/)
  - [valid parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)

1. **In-class demo:** Instructors demo a technical interview - one interviews the other. Allocate approx. 20min for the problem and 5-10min for feedback. See [this list of leetcode problems](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nrFWrZSIDsGW3vUalt4zIqorE2xuRB5Au3zkMzNY-uQ/edit?usp=sharing) for some good candidates. The problem should be relatively simple and does **not** have to specifically be a Data Structures problem. The focus should be on the process.

2. **In-class exercise:** Students take 30 minutes to work on a simple leetcode problem from the list. Should **not** be a data structures problem - focus is in the process. Allocate approx. 10min for group feedback / discussion afterwards.

## TLO's (Terminal Learning Objectives)

- Learn and able to apply the basic whiteboarding problem strategy.

## ELO's (Enabling Learning Objectives)

- Can explain what the interviewer is looking for in a technical interview and what we are being evaluated on in a technical interview.
