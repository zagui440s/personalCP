# Sorting Algorithms

## What are we trying to accomplish?

You will learn about the Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Merge Sort sorting algorithms. You will learn the algorithm itself, discover what kind of data produces best-case, average-case, or worst-case time complexity for each algorithm, and you will learn how to implement each algorithm.

This will help you understand fundamental concepts of sorting, foster algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills, and give you a foundation to learn more advanced algorithms.

Understanding these sorting algorithms will provide you with a solid foundation in algorithmic thinking and performance analysis, enabling you to choose the most appropriate sorting method based on the characteristics of your data.

## TLO's (Tangible Learning Objectives)

- None of these concepts will be evaluated here in Code Platoon but they will be expected of you upon reaching the interview process or possibly your first job.

## ELO's (Enabling Learning Objectives)

- Bubble sort: Implement it, be able to explain its runtime complexity, and give examples of different inputs resulting in best-case, worst-case, or average-case complexity.
- Insertion Sort: Implement insertion sort, explain its runtime complexity, and give examples of different inputs resulting in best-case, worst-case, or average-case complexity.
- Merge Sort: Implement it iteratively (not recursively) and explain its runtime complexity, and give examples of different inputs resulting in best-case, worst-case, or average-case complexity.
