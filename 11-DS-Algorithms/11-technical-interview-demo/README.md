# Technical Interviews & White-board Problems

## What are we trying to accomplish?

Technical Interviews, sometimes referred to as 'whiteboarding problems', are their own beasts. You will learn the format these interviews take, and how interviewers assess your performance.

You will learn the strategies & techniques to succeed at these whiteboarding / technical interview problems, which are also helpful as general program design techniques.

You will also become more familiar with leetcode, since there is a strong chance that in the interview process you will do a coding challenge or problem in leetcode or a similar tool.

## Instructor Notes & Prerequisites

If possible review data structures but the priority is introducing how to tackle whiteboarding problems. **Two instructors should demo doing a technical interview problem on leetcode.**

## Lectures & Assignments

- [Lecture: Brief overview of the leetcode platform](./1-leetcode.md)
  - Assignment - Students do the Cassie's Data Structures Workshop Problems from [this list of leetcode problems](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nrFWrZSIDsGW3vUalt4zIqorE2xuRB5Au3zkMzNY-uQ/edit?usp=sharing).
    - Try to finish all the "dictionaries", "arrays", and "strings" problems.
- [Lecture: How to succeed at whiteboarding problems](./2-how-to-succeed-at-whiteboarding-problems.md)
  - [**Here is a shorter "cheat sheet" for Whiteboarding Problems**](./resources/whiteboarding-problems-cheat-sheet.md)
  - [Sort a linked list](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-list/)
  - [Remove nodes from LL](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nodes-from-linked-list/)
  - [valid parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)

1. **In-class demo:** Instructors demo a technical interview - one interviews the other. Allocate approx. 20min for the problem and 5-10min for feedback. See [this list of leetcode problems](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nrFWrZSIDsGW3vUalt4zIqorE2xuRB5Au3zkMzNY-uQ/edit?usp=sharing) for some good candidates. The problem should be relatively simple and does **not** have to specifically be a Data Structures problem. The focus should be on the process.

2. **In-class exercise:** Students take 30 minutes to work on a simple leetcode problem from the list. Should **not** be a data structures problem - focus is in the process. Allocate approx. 10min for group feedback / discussion afterwards.

## TLO's (Terminal Learning Objectives)

- N/A This will not be evaluated in Code Platoon

## ELO's (Enabling Learning Objectives)

- Familiarity with the leetcode platform
- Learn and able to apply whiteboarding problem strategies.
- Can explain what the interviewer is looking for in a technical interview and what we are being evaluated on in a technical interview.
