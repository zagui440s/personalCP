# Computer Memory and Linked List

## What are we trying to accomplish?

By learning about computer memory, arrays, and linked lists, you are aiming to gain a deeper understanding of how data is stored and manipulated in a computer's memory. This knowledge empowers you to write more efficient and scalable code by better understanding how your program interacts with computer memory for making informed decisions about memory usage. This is crucial for optimizing performance, preventing memory-related issues, and designing data structures that adapt dynamically to changing requirements.

The Array data structure is a fundamental 'building block' for more complex data structures. Understanding how arrays are stored in memory and why that matters will help you better understand more complex data structures.

The Linked list data structure offers a flexible alternative to traditional arrays, enabling you to tackle problems related to dynamic data, insertion, and deletion more effectively. Ultimately, this knowledge equips you with the skills to create robust and memory-conscious solutions in your software development endeavors.
