It’s important to note that **none** of these lectures content are ready to be presented and need to be adjusted

## Content we are missing
- Hash tables 
- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort)
  - We used to have a lesson on bubble sort somewhere I know I got it when I was a student so it’s in Romeo at the very least 
- Divide and Conquer Algorithms (merge sort)
- Doubly and Circular Linked Lists

## Tasks 
- [ ] Organize current content to the correct order
- [ ] Iterate through current content and ensure it meets curriculum standards 
- [ ] Go through previous cohorts and Evening and Weekends program to grab material we may need
- [ ] Create new content 
- [ ] Create/find assignments (2 from our assignments org and 1 from leet code)
