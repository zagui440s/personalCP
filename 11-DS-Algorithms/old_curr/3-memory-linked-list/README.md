# Computer Memory and Linked List

## What are we trying to accomplish?

By learning about computer memory and linked lists, you are aiming to gain a deeper understanding of how data is stored and manipulated in a computer's memory. This knowledge empowers you to write more efficient and scalable code by making informed decisions about memory usage, which is crucial for optimizing performance, preventing memory-related issues, and designing data structures that adapt dynamically to changing requirements. Linked lists, as a specific data structure, offer a flexible alternative to traditional arrays, enabling you to tackle problems related to dynamic data, insertion, and deletion more effectively. Ultimately, this knowledge equips you with the skills to create robust and memory-conscious solutions in your software development endeavors.
