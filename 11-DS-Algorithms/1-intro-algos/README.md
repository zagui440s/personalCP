# Intro to Data Structures and Algorithms

## What are we trying to accomplish?

Learning about linear search versus binary search provides a fundamental understanding of two distinct searching algorithms and their respective efficiency in different scenarios. Linear search involves sequentially checking each element in a list, making it suitable for unsorted data but potentially less efficient for large datasets. In contrast, binary search excels in sorted data by repeatedly dividing the search space in half, resulting in significantly faster search times. By grasping the strengths and weaknesses of these algorithms, learners gain valuable insights into algorithmic efficiency, enabling them to make informed choices about the most appropriate search method based on the characteristics of the data they are working with. This knowledge is crucial for optimizing code performance and developing effective problem-solving skills in various programming and computational contexts.

## Lessons & Assignments

- [Lesson - Linear Search](./1-simple-search.md)
- [Lesson - Binary Search](./2-binary-search.md)
  - [Assignment - Linear vs Binary](https://github.com/Code-Platoon-Assignments/ds-linear-vs-binary-search/tree/main)
  - [Assignment - Refactor](.): One of the most important parts about programming is having the ability to visit previously written code and refactor our work to make it more efficient. Go through the assignments you've completed so far and think about which problems you can solve in a more effective way. It doesn't have to be binary search, maybe there's a different method or a different Data Type you can utilize in programs to make them more efficient.
